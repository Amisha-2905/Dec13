Some tips to keep in mind while web designing:-
<p>
    Start with a pen and paper, not a mouse and keyboard.
    Always start with a pencil and a blank piece of paper. That’s the best way to get the best designs.
    Do sketches on paper, not in design software, so you don’t limit your ideas to your current technological capabilities.
</p>
<p>
        For a good design, follow the K.I.S.S approach which means KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID.
</p>
<p>
    Empty space can be just as (or more) effective than images. Make good use of empty space.
    Consider white space your friend not your enemy.
</p>
<p>
    Understand color theory well to communicate your ideas better. Use less colour but don't be afraid to use colour.
</p>
<p>
    Focus on the user. It doesn’t matter how great the design is; if it’s not functional and cannot be found, it’s pretty useless.
</p>
<p>
    Save often. This advice might sound quite unimportant but your design talent is no match for a system failure or computer crash. Always save and back up your digital masterpieces… often!
